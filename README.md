# SoccerGame
First mini-game made with Unity for a first year university class.
- This was more of a testing game to be familiarized with Unity
- This game allows you to control a soccer ball and avoid obstacles in the path to reach the goal.

# Tartatrus
Second mini-game made with Unity for a first year university class.
- Slightly more polished than the first mini game; you control an animated character around a maze while avoiding being caught by a minotaur that chases after you.
